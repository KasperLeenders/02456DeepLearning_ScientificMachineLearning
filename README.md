In this work we have investigated the use of deep learning in solving differential equations. We have considered the Laplace equation with a given boundary condition. 
The problem origins from evolution of a free boundary surface of water waves where the Laplace equation should be solved in every time step using a known boundary conditon at the free surface of the water. Â¨

In this repositrory we have put two jupyter notebooks: One using feedforward neural networks for the task and one using a convolutional neural network. 
Furthermore we have added the used data in order to run the notebooks.
